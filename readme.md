## About Project

This is a Sample Website Template built with Laravel. That uses the Contact Page to accept messages from users and updates the Database. Then reads from the Database these messages, outputting them in a much more readable format on the Messages Page which is accessible via ../messages. This project clearly demonstrates the implementation of Views, Controllers and Routes in the Laravel Architecture.

## Installation Instructions

Clone or download project to your server. Don't forget to edit the .env and hosts files to match your Database and Server credentials. Then execute 'php artisan migrate' for migrations.
